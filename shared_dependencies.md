The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. AWS SDK: This is a shared dependency across all files as they all interact with AWS services.

2. Boto3: This is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc. It will be used in "aws_setup.py", "serverless_config.py", and "auto_scaling.py".

3. Serverless Framework: This is used in "serverless_config.py" for defining and deploying the serverless application.

4. AWS Lambda: This is used in "serverless_config.py" and "auto_scaling.py" for creating serverless functions and auto scaling rules respectively.

5. AWS DynamoDB: This is used in "ai_resources.py" and "ai_agents.py" for storing and retrieving AI resources and agents data.

6. AWS CloudWatch: This is used in "profitability_rules.py" for monitoring the profitability of the business.

7. AWS S3: This is used in "revenue_generation.py" for storing the generated revenue data.

8. AWS IAM: This is used in "aws_setup.py" for setting up the necessary permissions.

9. AWS EC2: This is used in "auto_scaling.py" for auto scaling the resources based on the load.

10. AWS API Gateway: This is used in "serverless_config.py" for setting up the API endpoints.

11. AWS Step Functions: This is used in "main.py" for orchestrating the workflow of the business plan.

12. Shared Variables: "initial_investment", "target_return", "current_revenue", "profitability_threshold" are shared across multiple files.

13. Shared Functions: "calculate_profitability", "generate_revenue", "scale_resources", "monitor_profitability" are shared across multiple files.

14. Data Schemas: "ai_resource_schema", "ai_agent_schema", "revenue_schema" are shared across multiple files.

15. Message Names: "ProfitabilityAlert", "RevenueUpdate", "ResourceScaling" are shared across multiple files.
